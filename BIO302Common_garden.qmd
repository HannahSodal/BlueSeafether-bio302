## Common garden experiment

This is a replication of the statistical methods used in the study: "A common-garden experiment to quantify evolutionary processes in copepods: the case of emamectin benzoate resistance in the parasitic sea louse *Lepeophtheirus salmonis*" DOI: <https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2148-14-108>.

In this study, seventeen full-sibling families were established from three strains of *Lepeophtheirus salmonis*, each displaying varying levels of emamectin benzoate (EB) tolerance. These families were quantitatively compared in a common-garden experimental design. The authors found significant differences in survival rates, with some families exhibiting higher resistance to EB than others.

This replication was carried out to assess the reproducibility of the study. While the article presents interesting findings, there are several concerns regarding data reproducibility.

```{r}
#| label: setup
#| message: false
#| echo: false

library(tidyverse)
library(janitor)
library(here)
library(readxl)
library(lme4)
library(patchwork)

```

*Importing the data:*

```{r}
#| label: data_import
#| message: false
#| output: false

# The import is complicated as the data needed to be filtered and transformed to fit the analysis
data <- read_excel("data/Data_CommonGarden_EBTrial.xls", sheet = 2) |> 
  select(1:6) |> 
  janitor::clean_names() |> 
  filter(status %in% c("SAT", "DAT")) |> 
  mutate(
    status = ifelse(status == "SAT", 1, 0),
    ex_group = case_when(
    family %in% c("Family-01", "Family-02") ~ "resistant",
    family %in% paste0("Family-0", 3:9) ~ "hybrid",
    family == "Family-10" ~ "sensitive",
    family %in% paste0("Family-", 11:17) ~ "unknown",
    TRUE ~ NA_character_  
  ))

```

The authors used AIC to determine the best model and conducted Chi-square tests to examine differences in survival between families and across different tanks. As the Chi-square tests yielded non-significant results, and based on AIC, the authors decided not to treat tanks as random effects. Below is the code for the Chi-square tests and the model used in the original study.

```{r}
#| label: chi_square_test

# Chi-square test for survival and experimental group
chisq.test(table(data$tank, data$ex_group))
# Chi-square test for survival and family
chisq.test(table(data$tank, data$family))
```

Looking at the summary, it clear that there are differences between the families.

```{r}
#| label: making_a_model

# Fit a linear mixed-effects model
mod <- lm(status ~ family + sex + tank, data = data)
summary(mod)
```

I choose to make figure 3 in the paper, as I could not locate the infection success data when I started reproducing the results (See data organization section above).

```{r}
#| label: plot_data

# Calculate survival ratios per tank (or unit) within each experimental group
group_box_data <- data |> 
  group_by(ex_group, tank) |> 
  summarise(survival_ratio = mean(status) * 100, .groups = 'drop')

# Plot Figure 3A
plot_3A <- ggplot(group_box_data, aes(x = ex_group, y = survival_ratio, fill = ex_group)) +
  geom_boxplot(outlier.shape = NA, width = 0.5) +
  stat_summary(fun = mean, geom = "point", shape = 3, size = 3, color = "black") + 
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("resistant" = "#D73027", 
                               "hybrid" = "orange2", 
                               "sensitive" = "#4575B4", 
                               "unknown" = "green4")) +
  labs(y = "SURVIVAL RATIO (%)", x = "EXPERIMENTAL GROUP") +
  theme_classic(base_size = 14) +
  ylim(0, 100)

# Calculate survival ratio per family per tank
family_box_data <- data |> 
  group_by(family, ex_group, tank) |> 
  summarise(survival_ratio = mean(status) * 100, .groups = 'drop') |> 
  mutate(family_number = as.numeric(gsub("Family-", "", family)))

# Plot Figure 3B
plot_3B <- ggplot(family_box_data, aes(x = factor(family_number), y = survival_ratio, fill = ex_group)) +
  geom_boxplot(outlier.shape = NA, width = 0.5) +
  stat_summary(fun = mean, geom = "point", shape = 3, size = 2, color = "black") + 
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("resistant" = "#D73027", 
                               "hybrid" = "orange2", 
                               "sensitive" = "#4575B4", 
                               "unknown" = "green4")) +
  labs(y = "SURVIVAL RATIO (%)", x = "FAMILY") +
  theme_classic(base_size = 14) +
  ylim(0, 100)

plot_3A / plot_3B + plot_layout(heights = c(1, 1))

Underneath you see the figure that i have replicated from the article. ![](data/BildeCommon.webp){width="60%"}
